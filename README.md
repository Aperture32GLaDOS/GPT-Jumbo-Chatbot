# GPT-Jumbo-Chatbot
Since ai21 recently made their GPT-Jumbo model public, I thought I would make a basic chatbot program for it.

Usage:

You'll need an ai21 API key; they give them out for free to anyone who has an account. Take care when using the script, though, as they limit you to 10,000 tokens per day.

Once you have your API key, replace {YOUR-API-KEY} in config.json with said key. Feel free to modify some of the other parameters if the responses are a bit too predictable (or too random)

Then, just run the script main.py with python main.py and answer all of the questions. The 'context' can be thought of as a description of the agent e.g. "Dave is a builder who likes to eat pizza"

Feel free to use in your own projects with or without credit (preferrably with); I just made this for fun.
